# webprog-anytone

TypeScript library to program Anytone DMR radios with prepared codeplugs.

## Running tests (radio must be plugged in)

```
npm run build && npm test dist/tests
```

## TODO

- get radio ID (done)
- read memory
- write memory
- make a codeplug facade so that it is easy to manipulate?
